    <h3><i>Description</i></h3>
    <p>My very own bacon jalapeno macaroni and cheese recipe. I usually cook this for friends and family at large occassions 
        such as thanksgiving (or friendsgiving) dinner, potlucks, and any event where I want to impress people with my cooking 
        skills.
    </p>
    <h3><i>Ingredients</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz cellentani pasta</li>
        <li>2 cups half n half</li>
        <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>2 cups grated cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 oz jalapenos</li>
        <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><i>Directions</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350 F and boil the pasta until it is al dente. Keep the half n half out of the fridge so it can
            unchill.</li>
        <li>In a sauce pan over low-medium heat, melt 3 tbsp butter and whisk in flour, in small increments, to make a roux.
            The roux should be a light brown color and smell like popcorn when ready.</li>
        <li>Take the roux off the heat and whisk in the half n half to make a bechamel sauce. Whisk until it reaches a smooth 
            and creamy consistency. Season the bechamel sauce with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the grated cheese, in 1/2 cup increments.</li>
        <li>Pour the cooked pasta into a baking tray and mix in your jalapenos. Then pour the cheese sauce into the baking
            tray.</li>
        <li>In a small pan, over medium heat, melt the remaining butter. Toast the panko breadcrumbs and the grated
            parmesan until golden brown. Season with black pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour the breadcrumbs evenly over the top of the baking tray. Bake in the oven for 30 min.</li>
    </ol>
